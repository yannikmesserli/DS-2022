# DS-2022
Repository of presentations for Esri's DevSummit 2022 in Palm Springs

# Setup

After cloning the repo, we need to install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To compile everything and serve the files:

```bash
npm start
```

Vite will then start up and prepare itself for serving the presentations. Once it's ready, it'll serve everything from http://localhost:3000/. From there, you can open one of the presentations.
